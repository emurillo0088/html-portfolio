<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Edwin Murillo and I am currently a student studying at California State University Northridge.
In addition to this, I am taking Dr. Angela Yu's full stack development course in Udemy which is where my portfolio project originates from. I plan to continue learning and 
hopefully I start freelancing to gain more experience with real world projects.
